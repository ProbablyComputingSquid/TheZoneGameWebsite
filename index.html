<h1><u><b>Description</b></u></h1>
<h3>The following is directly from the Tutorial Script</h3>
    </center>
    <p>Humanity is in somewhat collapse. We are running out of energy and resources. Complete ISLANDS have been flooded. Most of Florida is flooded, but Cape Canaveral is safe. For now. Global warming has accelerated so quickly, and most of the major cities will be completely flooded in 20 years. Our hope is to get to Proxima Centauri B, but we need nuclear power and more resources to power our spacecraft. You have been hired by (have different corporations to choose from) [insert company name here] to uncover secrets and to extract resources from the wreckage of Chernobyl. But, other companies have sent their workers and have goals of retrieving resources from Chernobyl. <br>
But, due to the recent influx of activity around Chernobyl, the UN has sent peacekeepers and planes to control and to expel the scavengers from Chernobyl. 
Expect bombing. They will bomb areas with high violence, but will not bomb near the power plant area in fear of re-igniting the wreckage. You would be in relative safety there. The UN is trying to get people to use other ways to collect resources of the spacecraft, just not scavenging resources from a still radioactive explosion site. Although Chernobyl had exploded a few hundred years ago, radioactive material has leaked out of one of the basements, and released radioactive dust and debris into the surrounding area. It is your mission to recover materials for fuel and for the ships, and to also get food for the people, because so much of the available farmland has been taken up or destroyed. Then bring back materials to the extraction point to power the spaceships and to feed people. Assorted materials would also be useful for building things on Proxima Centauri B. Then, we have planes that can airdrop you back into 'The Zone'. We can also provide airdrop packages, but you will have to contact us. Remember, you also have competitors.<Br>
You will get paid handsomely for your troubles. 
<br>Soldier, your mission begins now.
<br>What are you waiting for?
<br>Laziness is the key to failure.
